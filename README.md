# KADDEM

<p>The "KADDEM" project is a student contract management application designed to facilitate the distribution of students into teams within the member universities. The teams are divided into three levels: junior, senior, and expert, and are focused on specialties such as AI, networks, security, and cloud.</p>
<p>Through the application, students can apply for contracts based on their specialty and level. If a student is accepted into multiple teams, they will receive a separate contract for each activity. The contracts serve as a moral commitment between the student and their university, and the student is expected to actively participate in the development of their team.</p>
<p>Some of the specific features of the "KADDEM" project include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Team distribution: The application helps to define and implement a program for distributing students into teams within each department of the member universities.</li>
  <li>Specialty and level: Each team is focused on a specific specialty (AI, networks, security, cloud) and is comprised of students at one of the three levels (junior, senior, expert).</li>
  <li>Contracts: Students can apply for contracts based on their specialty and level, and will receive a separate contract for each activity if they are accepted into multiple teams.</li>
  <li>Moral commitment: The contracts serve as a moral commitment between the student and their university, and the student is expected to actively participate in the development of their team.</li>
</ul>
<p>The "KADDEM" project aims to provide students with valuable hands-on experience and help them develop their skills in their chosen specialty. It also helps universities to effectively allocate their students and ensure that each team has the necessary resources to complete their projects.</p>
